This is a project for an event that will be held in Techtorium Institute's campus.
The idea behind the event is to create a real-life quest game that will involve searching for and scanning QR-codes around the campus, 
and competing in the number of the codes scanned.

The idea was inspired by the rumour from the institute. 
There already are several QR-codes around the facility, and if you scan them all, you get to receive some prize from the institute. 
So this idea emerged to bring the rumour to life.

It is expected that the entire school will participate in this event. 
It could theoretically become a part of the end-of-term event known as 'Mad Day', which is comprised of various fun activities and games.

The outcomes of this event will be:
  -All students will get more fun at the end of the year, celebrating the end of their studies.
  -Usually, the Mad Day is held on campus, but this year in all terms from 1 to 3, it was online due to the current world situation. 
    Because of this, the event is not as fun and exciting as it used to be. So adding one more activity (The QR Hunt) will bring back its fame.
  -Techtorium Institute, as an inevitable sponsor, will benefit from the event
    as it will show its students that the institute puts effort into the school life and makes it interesting and fun.
  -As student graduates, the executing team of the project will be able to put the project into their portfolios to show their experience in carrying out such work.
